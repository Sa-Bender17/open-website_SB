# attributes file to over-ride line ending conversions 
# 2019-07-29
# md5sum utility doesn't like CR/LF endings in record lines.
#  so need to keep the file as generated by md5sum utility in
#  batch file RE_SIGZ.BAT
*.sig text eol=lf
*.md5 text eol=lf

# rtf (rich text format) files made by Doxygen might get converted since
#  are largely text looking, so tell git to treat as binary.
*.rtf binary
